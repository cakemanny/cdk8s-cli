### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **lib:** the deprecated API `Duration.toISOString()` has been removed. Use `Duration.toIsoString()` instead.
* **lib:** CAUTION! Auto-generated resource names will change with this release. Resource names in manifests synthesized by a previous version of the CDK8s will be invalidated. Deploying new manifests will cause **resources to be replaced**. Temporarily, you can opt to use the legacy hashing mechanism by setting the environment variable `CDK8S_LEGACY_HASH=1`.
* **lib:** `Names.toDnsLabel()` now accepts a construct scope instead of a string path, and a set of options instead of `maxLen`.
* **lib:** `Names.toLabelValue()` now accepts a construct scope instead of a string path, and a set of options instead of `maxLen`.

*By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license*
* **plus-17:** All L2 resource names will undergo a name change (e.g `test-chart-config-configmap-233db8e7` -> `test-chart-config-c3f7d3c0`)

Resolves https://github.com/awslabs/cdk8s/issues/373

*By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license*
* Construct input types generated by `cdk8s import` are now called `XxxProps` instead of `XxxOptions` to conform with the CDK ecosystem.
* **core:** `ApiObjectOptions` is now called `ApiObjectProps`
* **core:** `AppOptions` is now called `AppProps`
* **core:** `ChartOptions` is now called `ChartProps`
* **core:** `HelmOptions` is now called `HelmProps`
* **core:** `IncludeOptions` is now called `IncludeProps`
* **cli:** when importing k8s api objects using `cdk8s import`, non-stable APIs will be have an API level postfix. For example, k8s@1.18 will have an `IngressV1Beta1` API object.
* **cli:** The `--include` CLI option has been removed since all API objects are always imported.
* **cli:** When using the CLI to import the core Kubernetes API objects, the imported classes will now have a `Kube` prefix in order to make it easier to differentiate them from the classes offered by the high-level APIs in CDK8s+ (e.g. `k8s.Deployment` is now `k8s.KubeDeployment`). You can disable through the `--no-class-prefix` option: `cdk8s import --no-class-prefix k8s`.
* **plus:** Containers now need to be inputed as interfaces rather than classes. Instead of passing `new kplus.Container(props)`, simply pass in `props`.

*By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license*
* **lib:** `EnvValue.fromSecret(secret, key)` has been removed in favor of `EnvValue.fromSecretValue({ secret, key })`.
* **plus:** `spec` was removed from all cdk8s+ constructs and that now have a flat structure. See [Example](https://github.com/awslabs/cdk8s/tree/master/packages/cdk8s-plus#at-a-glance) for new usage.

* **plus**: Construct id's for deployment will change due to a latent bug that appended the word `pod` to them.

*By submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache-2.0 license*
* **plus:** `deployment.expose()` now takes `port` as a positional argument (before: `deployment.expose({ port })`, now: `deployment.expose(port)`).

* **lib:** `cdk8s` discontinues support for the `onPrepare` and `onSynthesis` construct hooks. These methods will eventually be removed from the `constructs` programming model.
* **cli:** enum string values are now proper enums instead of just `string`s.

* **cli:** the generated module names of imported CRDs now include the resource's group and not just its kind in order to ensure uniqueness. For example, when importing the Jenkins CRD, instead of 'imports/jenkins.ts`, we now have `imports/jenkins.io/jenkins.ts`.
- **cli**: class names are now normalized to `PascalCase`.
* please upgrade your dependency requirement for "constructs" to ^2.0.0
* **cli:** `cdk8s gen` is now `cdk8s import k8s` and output goes to `imports/k8s.ts` instead of `.gen/index.ts`.
* **cli:** `cdk8s import` now generates a single file with all types, which means you will have to modify TypeScript code to `import { Deployment, Pod, ... } from './imports/k8s'` instead of importing multiple files.
